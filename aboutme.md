My name is Elliot Cazar. I have the following qualities:

- Currently in my second year studying Computer Science Engineering at the National Polytechnic School.
- Certified industrial drone pilot issued by ADS (Aerial Development Services
- Advanced Level 2 English Certificate issued by CEC (Continuing Education Center

My Interests:

- I really enjoy talking to people about anything; I also like to joke around, but in a friendly way.
- I'm interested in military topics, military politics, the technologies used in wars, and the development of new technology in that field.
- I enjoy exploring and getting to know new places and people; I don't like staying in one place for too long.

Habilitys:

- In difficult situations, whether they're academic or social, I always manage to find an effective solution, whether it's hard to implement or easy. This ability has helped me to come out successfully from stressful situations, such as possibly failing a course, facing setbacks in academic projects, or encountering social problems with peers.
