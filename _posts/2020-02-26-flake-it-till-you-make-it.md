In this joint work with the ATA laboratory, we managed to build a UAV from scratch that operates correctly using radio waves for control. The first step was creating the UAV frame. This frame was constructed by downloading a 3D model from the internet. Then, we proceeded to gather the necessary materials for construction: propellers, rotary motors, antenna, etc.
